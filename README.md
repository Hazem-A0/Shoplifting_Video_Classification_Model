# Shoplifting

In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying shoplifting activities in video footage. The dataset consists of two classes of videos: shoplifters and non-shoplifters. The model is designed to detect shoplifting behavior by analyzing video sequences, leveraging both spatial and temporal information from the video frames.
